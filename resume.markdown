# Ilia Lobsanov - Senior Software Engineer

I have been writing software professionally since 2000, and specializing in Ruby since 2010. 
My experience is backend oriented, but I can also work on the front-end, with recent experience in Hotwire, React, and Tailwind CSS.  
➡️ I'm currently looking to join a product company that uses Ruby on Rails.
